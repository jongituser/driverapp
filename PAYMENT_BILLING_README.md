## Business Logic

### Payment Processing Flow

1. **Initiation**: User initiates payment for a delivery
2. **Provider Integration**: System calls appropriate payment provider
3. **Transaction Creation**: Payment record created with PENDING status
4. **Confirmation**: User confirms payment via provider
5. **Status Update**: Payment status updated to COMPLETED/FAILED
6. **Wallet Credit**: Driver wallet credited upon successful payment

### Invoice Generation Flow

1. **Delivery Completion**: System tracks completed deliveries
2. **Periodic Aggregation**: Monthly/weekly aggregation of partner services
3. **Invoice Creation**: Automatic invoice generation with unique number
4. **Notification**: Invoice sent to partner
5. **Payment Tracking**: Monitor payment status and due dates
6. **Overdue Handling**: Automatic overdue status updates

### Driver Earnings Flow

1. **Delivery Completion**: Driver completes delivery
2. **Earnings Calculation**: 75% of delivery price calculated as earnings
3. **Earnings Record**: DriverEarning record created with PENDING status
4. **Payout Processing**: Batch or individual payout processing
5. **Wallet Credit**: Driver wallet credited upon successful payout

### Wallet Operations

1. **Balance Validation**: Check sufficient balance before debit operations
2. **Transaction Recording**: Every operation creates a transaction record
3. **Balance Update**: Atomic balance updates with transaction history
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for all wallet operations

## Security & Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control

- **ADMIN**: Full access to all payment and billing operations
- **MANAGER**: Access to payment processing, invoice management, and reporting
- **USER**: Limited access to initiate payments and view own transactions

### Security Features

- **Transaction Validation**: All financial operations validated
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance
- **Balance Protection**: Insufficient balance prevention
- **Provider Security**: Secure integration with payment providers
